# PGMN

A continuous learning framework is described in the article "Pooling-based Gate Networks for Dynamic Modular Continual Learning". Our goal is to build an effective continuous learning learner who can accurately identify different task categories, enable knowledge transfer, and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. As a modular approach, PGMN can be roughly divided into three parts: pool gated network, extended network and module weight regularizer.
